<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioactive Fillings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Fillings</li><li>Indirect Fillings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioactive fillings market encompasses two primary types: direct fillings and indirect fillings. Direct fillings involve the immediate placement of bioactive materials into a cavity, allowing for quick restoration and superior bonding with tooth structure. In contrast, indirect fillings are crafted outside the mouth, typically using techniques like inlays or onlays, and then bonded to the tooth, providing enhanced durability. Both types aim to restore dental health while promoting biological interactions that support healing and regeneration of the surrounding tissues.</p></p>
