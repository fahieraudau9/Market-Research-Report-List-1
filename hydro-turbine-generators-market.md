<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydro Turbine Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impulse Hydro Turbine Generator</li><li>Reaction Hydro Turbine Generator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hydro turbine generator market comprises two primary types: impulse and reaction. Impulse hydro turbine generators operate using high-velocity water jets that strike turbine blades, converting kinetic energy into mechanical energy. They are typically used in high-head applications. In contrast, reaction hydro turbine generators rely on the pressure difference created by flowing water, driving the turbine blades through both pressure and gravity. They are commonly employed in lower-head applications. Both types play crucial roles in renewable energy generation.</p></p>
